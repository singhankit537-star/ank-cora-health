# Review Rulebook

## Purpose

Strict standards for code review by the REVIEWER agent to ensure architectural integrity, security, and maintainability.

---

## Absolute Rules & Constraints

| Priority | Rule | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| 🔴 CRITICAL | NO APPROVAL WITHOUT TESTS | Untested code or failing tests = Auto-Reject. You must verify that tests exist and are meaningful. |
| 🔴 CRITICAL | NO APPROVAL WITH BLOCKERS | All Critical/High (🔴) severity issues must be resolved before approval can be given. |
| 🔴 CRITICAL | ZERO SECRET POLICY | Any hardcoded secret or API key is an immediate Blocker. |
| 🔴 CRITICAL | ARCHITECTURE MATCH | Must follow Clean Architecture (inward dependencies) and strict pattern compliance. |
| 🟡 REQUIRED | READ FIRST | Always read architecture docs and patterns before reviewing. |
| 🟡 REQUIRED | VERIFY EVIDENCE | Manually check test logs and coverage reports to verify the developer's evidence. |
| 🟡 REQUIRED | DOCUMENT FINDINGS & FIXES | Document all issues with severity, specific file lines, and suggest exact code snippets for the fix. |
| 🟡 REQUIRED | REFERENCE PATTERNS | Cite specific pattern docs and architecture sections as evidence in every review comment. |
| 🟡 REQUIRED | WRITE ONLY TO | Restrict modifications strictly to the `docs/reviews/` directory. |

## Review Checklist

### Architecture & Design
- [ ] **Clean Architecture**: Dependencies point inward (Domain/Core remains pure)
- [ ] **SOLID Principles**: SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, and DIP strictly followed
- [ ] **No God Objects**: Files <400 lines; Classes <10 public methods
- [ ] **No Anemic Models**: Domain entities contain logic/behavior, not just data
- [ ] **Module Boundaries**: No circular dependencies between packages/modules

### Code Quality
- [ ] **Readability**: Intent is clear and code is self-documenting
- [ ] **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity is low (<10)
- [ ] **Functions**: Small and focused (<50 lines)
- [ ] **DRY**: No significant code duplication
- [ ] **Constants**: No magic numbers; all constants defined at the top or in config
- [ ] **Linter**: Zero warnings/errors confirmed in evidence

### Testing
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Exist, pass, and follow AAA pattern
- [ ] **Behavioral**: Test names express "what it does" not "how it works"
- [ ] **Coverage**: Minimum 85% verified via coverage report
- [ ] **Mocks**: Used only for external boundaries (API/DB)
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Boundary and error conditions fully tested

### Security
- [ ] **Secrets**: No API keys, passwords, or tokens in code (use env vars)
- [ ] **Input**: All user inputs validated/sanitized
- [ ] **Auth**: Authentication and Authorization enforced on all endpoints
- [ ] **Injection**: Parameterized queries used for DB; XSS protection for UI
- [ ] **Encryption**: Sensitive data (PII) encrypted at rest and in transit

## Issue Severity Levels

| Level | Icon | Description | Action Required |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Blocker** | 🔴 | Critical issue, breaks functionality, security vulnerability | MUST fix before merge |
| **High** | 🟠 | Significant issue, deviates from patterns, missing tests | SHOULD fix before merge |
| **Medium** | 🟡 | Code smell, minor pattern deviation, improvement opportunity | CAN fix after merge |
| **Low** | 🟢 | Suggestion, style preference, nice-to-have | OPTIONAL |

## Issue Categories

| Category | What It Covers |
|----------|---------------|
| **Correctness** | Logic errors, bugs, wrong behavior |
| **Pattern** | Deviation from documented patterns |
| **Testing** | Missing tests, poor test quality |
| **Security** | Vulnerabilities, data exposure |
| **Performance** | Inefficient code, N+1 queries |
| **Documentation** | Missing/incorrect comments/docs |
| **Style** | Naming, formatting, organization |
| **Maintainability** | Hard to read, modify, or test |

## Review Verdict

| Verdict | Requirements | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| ✅ **APPROVED** | Zero blockers, all checks pass | Merge allowed |
| 🔄 **CHANGES REQUESTED** | Blockers or high issues exist | DEV must fix and re-submit |
| ❌ **REJECTED** | Critical security or architecture breach | Escalate to ARCHITECT |

## Red Flags During Review

| Red Flag | Severity | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| No tests | 🔴 Blocker | Cannot approve |
