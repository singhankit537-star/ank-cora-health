# Brownfield - Implementation Plan

## Agent

**PRODUCT_OWNER** 

## Before Starting

1. Read `SPEC/agents/AIRE_PRODUCT_OWNER.md`
2. Read `SPEC/rulebooks/aire-brownfield-rulebook.md`
3. **CRITICAL**: Read `SPEC/templates/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_FORMAT.md` for mandatory format
4. Read `docs/requirements.md`
5. Read `docs/architecture/current/00-system-overview.md`
6. Read all `docs/architecture/current/01-*-deep-dive.md` files
7. **Read**: `docs/architecture/design/02-target-architecture-brownfield.md`.
8. **Read**: `docs/architecture/design/03-patterns-and-standards-brownfield.md`.
9. **OPTIONAL UI/UX**: Ask user if UI/UX design needed
10. **IF UI/UX DONE**: Read `docs/ui-ux/ui-ux-spec.md` for design tokens
11. **SEQUENTIAL NUMBERING**: Check for existing epics/stories and ask user for starting numbers
12. **BUILD CYCLE CHECK** *(optional)*: Check if `docs/plans/builds/` exists. If it does, follow build-cycle integration below. If it does not, ask the user: "No build cycles found. Run `aire-build-cycles` first, or proceed without cycles? (cycles are optional)". If user proceeds without, skip BUILDID assignment entirely.

---

## STEP 0: Prerequisites Check (ALWAYS DO THIS FIRST)

Before anything else, verify ALL required inputs exist:

1. **Check for requirements**: `docs/requirements.md`
2. **Check for system overview**: `docs/architecture/current/00-system-overview.md`
3. **Check for deep-dive analysis**: `docs/architecture/current/01-*-deep-dive.md`
4. **Check for target architecture**: `docs/architecture/design/02-target-architecture-brownfield.md`
5. **Check for patterns & standards**: `docs/architecture/design/03-patterns-and-standards-brownfield.md`

**If requirements are missing**:
```
❌ docs/requirements.md not found
   → Please run: aire-brownfield-requirements
```

**If system overview or deep-dive are missing**:
```
❌ docs/architecture/current/ not found or empty
   → Please run: aire-brownfield-inspect then aire-brownfield-deep-dive
```

**If target architecture is missing**:
```
❌ docs/architecture/design/02-target-architecture-brownfield.md not found
   → Please run: aire-brownfield-architecture
```

**If patterns & standards are missing**:
```
❌ docs/architecture/design/03-patterns-and-standards-brownfield.md not found
   → Please run: aire-brownfield-patterns
```

**If ALL exist**, confirm and continue:
```
✅ Prerequisites found:
   ✓ Requirements: docs/requirements.md
   ✓ System overview: docs/architecture/current/00-system-overview.md
   ✓ Deep-dive: docs/architecture/current/[files found]
   ✓ Target architecture: docs/architecture/design/02-target-architecture-brownfield.md
   ✓ Patterns & standards: docs/architecture/design/03-patterns-and-standards-brownfield.md

Proceeding to implementation planning...
```

---

## STEP 1: Epic/Story Numbering (ALWAYS DO THIS FIRST)

**CRITICAL**: Before creating the implementation plan, determine the starting epic/story numbers.

### Check Existing Implementation Plan

1. **Read the existing plan** (if it exists):
   - Check if `docs/plans/implementation-plan.md` exists
   - If it exists, read the entire file
   - Find all Epic headers: `## EPIC N:` or `# Epic N:`
   - Find all Story headers: `### Story N.M:` or `## Story N.M:`
   - Also scan `docs/plans/stories/` for existing story files
   - Identify the **highest Epic number** and **highest Story number**

2. **Determine next numbers**:
   - If **no implementation plan exists**: Start from Epic 1, Story 1.1
   - If **plan exists with Epic X, Story X.Y as last**:
     - For adding stories to same epic: Epic X, Story X.(Y+1)
     - For new major feature: Epic (X+1), Story (X+1).1

3. **Ask User to Confirm**:
   ```
   📊 Current Implementation Plan Status:

   [If plan exists]
   ✓ Found existing implementation-plan.md
   ✓ Last Epic: Epic X
   ✓ Last Story: Story X.Y

   [If no plan exists]
   ℹ️  No existing implementation-plan.md found
   ℹ️  This will be the first implementation plan

   💡 Recommended Starting Point:

   For brownfield projects (adding features to existing code):
   - ALWAYS continue sequentially: Epic (X+1), Story (X+1).1

   Options:
   1. Start new epic (Epic [X+1], Story [X+1].1) - recommended for new feature
   2. Continue in current epic (Epic [X], Story [X.Y+1]) - only if extending same feature
   3. Specify custom epic/story numbers

   Which option? (1-3):
   ```

4. **Confirm Final Numbers**:
   ```
   ✅ Confirmed: Starting from:
   - First Epic: [N]
   - First Story: [N.1]

   Ready to proceed? (yes/no)
   ```

### CRITICAL Rules for Sequential Numbering

- ✅ **ALWAYS continue sequentially** - never reset to Epic 1, Story 1.1 unless truly the first plan
- ✅ **Read the file first** - don't guess, actually read `docs/plans/implementation-plan.md`
- ✅ **Ask user to confirm** - show what you found and what you'll use
- ❌ **NEVER reset numbering** - brownfield projects build on existing work
- ❌ **NEVER overwrite** existing epics - always increment

---

## BUILD CYCLE INTEGRATION (BUILDID)

**CRITICAL**: If build cycles have been planned (via `aire-build-cycles`), every story MUST carry a BUILDID.

### Detect Active Cycle

1. Check if `docs/plans/builds/` directory exists
2. If it exists, list all `docs/plans/builds/cycle-[N]/cycle-plan.md` files
3. Ask user:

```
Build cycles detected:
  - Cycle 1 (CYCLE-1): [scope from cycle-plan.md]
  - Cycle 2 (CYCLE-2): [scope from cycle-plan.md]
  ...

Which cycle are you planning stories for?
Enter cycle number (e.g., 1 for CYCLE-1):
```

4. Set `BUILDID = CYCLE-[N]` for all stories in this planning session
5. Read the corresponding `docs/plans/builds/cycle-[N]/cycle-plan.md` to scope the stories

### BUILDID in Story Files

Every story file MUST include the BUILDID and Jira traceability in the header:

```
### Story N.M: [Title]

**BUILDID**: CYCLE-[N] | **Epic**: N - [NAME] | **ID**: N.M | **Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD] | **Jira**: [JIRA-ID]
```

### Jira Traceability (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Check `docs/requirements.md` for the "Jira Stories Imported" table. If requirements were sourced from Jira (Path J in `aire-brownfield-requirements`), every story that maps to an imported Jira issue MUST carry the original Jira ID.

- **Jira-sourced story**: `**Jira**: PROJ-101` (exact Jira issue key from requirements.md)
- **Locally-created story** (no Jira origin): `**Jira**: LOCAL`
- **Story covering multiple Jira issues**: `**Jira**: PROJ-101, PROJ-102`

This traceability is used in Phase 4 to determine export behavior.

### If No Build Cycles Exist

If `docs/plans/builds/` does not exist or is empty, skip BUILDID assignment. Stories are created without BUILDID (backwards compatible).

---

## MANDATORY FORMAT

**You MUST follow the exact format specified in `SPEC/templates/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_FORMAT.md`**

This ensures:
- ✅ Each story contains complete implementation details
- ✅ Code examples are included in every story
- ✅ Test requirements are comprehensive
- ✅ Each story file is self-contained — AI agents have full context without loading the entire plan

---

## Execution Steps:

### Phase 1: Plan Structure

- [ ] Read `docs/requirements.md` — all features, success criteria, scope
- [ ] Read `docs/architecture/current/` — system overview + deep-dive patterns
- [ ] If BUILDID set: scope stories to the active cycle's plan only

#### 1a — Check for Jira Stories Table in Requirements

- [ ] Check if `docs/requirements.md` contains a **"Jira Stories Imported"** table
- [ ] If YES (Jira-sourced requirements): use **1:1 Jira Story Mapping** (see below)
- [ ] If NO (local requirements): use **Vertical Slice Planning** (see below)

#### 1b — Jira-Sourced: 1:1 Story Mapping (when requirements have Jira table)

When `docs/requirements.md` has a "Jira Stories Imported" table, create **one implementation story file per Jira story**:

- [ ] Read the Jira Stories table — each row = one implementation story
- [ ] Group stories by Epic (use the Jira Epic column, or group by theme from Functional Requirements)
- [ ] For each Jira story, create a matching implementation story that:
  - Preserves the original Jira ID in the header (`**Jira**: PROJ-101`)
  - Uses the original Jira title as the story title
  - Keeps original Description, AC, Out of Scope from requirements.md
  - Derives implementation steps, prerequisites, patterns, tests from architecture docs
- [ ] Assign sequential epic/story numbers (from STEP 1 numbering)
- [ ] Each story carries the BUILDID if cycles are active

**Story file header format for Jira-sourced stories:**

```
### Story N.M: [ORIGINAL JIRA TITLE — unchanged]

**BUILDID**: CYCLE-[N] | **Jira**: [JIRA-ID] | **Epic**: N - [NAME] | **ID**: N.M | **Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
```

**Example mapping:**

```
Jira Stories from requirements.md:
  PROJ-101: "Export leads to CSV"        → Epic 1, Story 1.1 (CYCLE-1, Jira: PROJ-101)
  PROJ-102: "PDF report for leads"       → Epic 1, Story 1.2 (CYCLE-1, Jira: PROJ-102)
  PROJ-103: "Email notification system"  → Epic 2, Story 2.1 (CYCLE-1, Jira: PROJ-103)
  PROJ-104: "Dashboard analytics"        → Epic 3, Story 3.1 (CYCLE-2, Jira: PROJ-104)
```

#### 1c — Local Requirements: Vertical Slice Planning (when no Jira table)

When `docs/requirements.md` was created locally (PATH L), define epics using **VERTICAL FEATURE SLICES**:

- [ ] Each epic = ONE complete feature across ALL layers
- [ ] Within each epic, order stories: Backend API → Frontend UI → Integration/Wiring
- [ ] Break into stories (1-4 hours each)
- [ ] Each story gets `**Jira**: LOCAL` in the header

**❌ FORBIDDEN (Horizontal/Layer-Based)**:

```
Epic 1: Add All Backend Features
  Story 1.1: Webhook receiver
  Story 1.2: All API endpoints

Epic 2: Add All Frontend Features
  Story 2.1: Dashboard scaffolding
  Story 2.2: All components

Problem: Nothing testable until everything is connected
```

**✅ REQUIRED (Vertical/Feature-Based)**:

```
Epic 1: Repository Management (Complete Feature)
  Story 1.1: Repository API (Backend - CRUD endpoints)
  Story 1.2: PAT Storage (Backend - secure token storage)
  Story 1.3: Repository Form (Frontend - add repo UI)
  Story 1.4: Repository List (Frontend - display repos)
  Story 1.5: Integration Test (End-to-end repo management)
  ✅ TESTABLE: User can add/view/delete repositories
```

### Phase 1.5: Story-Dependency Graph (MANDATORY when plan has 2+ stories)

Before writing any story files, produce `docs/plans/dependency-graph.yml` per `SPEC/templates/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_FORMAT.md`. The graph groups stories into **waves of independent work**. Each story carries a `wave: N` field that gets pushed to Jira / GitHub as a `wave-N` label in Phase 4 so the board can be filtered by wave.

**Scope of this phase**: produce the YAML, validate it manually against the rules below, and confirm with the user. **Story-file authoring stays one-at-a-time in Phase 3.**

The graph does NOT route work to specific developers. It declares which stories are independent. Anyone on the team can pick any story from the current ready wave on the Jira / GitHub board.

---

**Step 1 — Ask `team_size` (justify it explicitly):**

```
❓ How many developers will be working on this project?

   Used SOLELY as a story-granularity hint. The planner aims to split
   stories so each wave contains at least `team_size` independent stories
   where the architecture allows, so no developer is blocked waiting on
   another's work-in-progress.

   - Solo dev (team_size: 1): normal granularity; waves still group
     independent stories so you can pick the next safe story without
     manual dependency analysis.
   - 2+ devs: planner pushes harder to make wave members independent,
     and surfaces shared-file conflicts before they cause merge pain.

   This is NOT a routing setting. Stories are never auto-assigned to
   specific developers — anyone on the team can pick any story from the
   current ready wave on the Jira / GitHub board.
```

Record the answer in the YAML's `team_size:` field.

---

**Step 2 — For each story, populate the graph entry:**

- `id`, `title`, `epic`: from the plan structure.
- `jira`: copy the Jira ID for Jira-sourced stories; else `LOCAL` (Phase 4 updates this).
- `github: null`: placeholder; Phase 4 updates it.
- `requires`: from architecture-natural ordering, informed by module dependencies discovered in the deep-dive. Apply the **TRUE-PARALLELISM RULES** below before finalizing.
- `enables`: reverse edges (informational).
- `files_touched`: from AIRE_ARCHITECT's File/Module Boundary Map in the brownfield patterns doc, intersected with the existing module each story touches.
- `wave`: filled in by Step 5.

---

**Step 3 — TRUE-PARALLELISM RULES (apply when computing `requires`):**

These rules prevent the two real failure modes: (a) artificial blocking that idles developers, and (b) cross-branch merge conflicts on shared files.

**R1. Seed-wave rule (BLOCKING — prevents unmergeable conflicts).** Any file in `shared_files` that does NOT yet exist in the repo must be **created** in a single "seed" story in wave 1, with every other wave-1 story `requires`-ing it. *Brownfield note*: in most brownfield projects the shared root files already exist, so R1 is a no-op for them. It applies when introducing a NEW shared file (a new central registry, a new shared types barrel, a new migrations dir).

**R2. Contract-not-implementation rule.** A story `requires` another only when it needs the other's **code to exist at compile/run time**, not just its API shape. If story B only needs A's request/response shape, B does NOT need `requires: [A]` — implement against the contract.

**R3. Frontend-may-mock rule.** A frontend story that calls a backend endpoint MAY drop `requires: [<backend story>]` when ALL of:
- The endpoint's contract is fixed, AND
- The frontend story's tests use MSW (or equivalent) handlers, AND
- A separate integration-test story verifies real-API wiring.

**R4. No-artificial-chains rule.** If two stories don't actually need each other's code, they get separate root nodes. Let real code dependencies decide ordering, not epic narrative.

**R5. Wave-width target.** Aim for each wave to contain at least `team_size` independent stories where architecture allows. Split chunky stories into 2 parallel ones over one big sequential one — but stop splitting when sub-stories drop below 1–2 hours.

---

**Step 4 — Identify `shared_files` (BLOCKING — do NOT skip):**

**4.1 Auto-detect overlap candidates.** Walk every story's `files_touched` and build a frequency map: any file path appearing in **2 or more** stories is a candidate.

**4.2 Add the always-shared baseline + brownfield-specific files.** The following must be in `shared_files` if they exist in this project:
- Every `package.json` (root + per-workspace)
- Every `tsconfig*.json`, lockfiles, lint/format configs
- Central route registries (discovered during deep-dive — use ACTUAL paths)
- Root app bootstrap files (discovered during deep-dive)
- Migrations index directory
- Shared type/interface barrel files
- Root config (`.env.example`, `.gitignore`, base tsconfig)
- CI/DevOps shared files
- **Brownfield-specific**: DI container / IoC registry, plugin registration file, feature-flag registry — typically already exist in the codebase and ARE shared.

**4.3 Present `shared_files` to the user for explicit confirmation.** Block on response.

**4.4 BLOCKING self-check.** For each pair of stories in the same candidate wave, check whether they overlap on any file NOT in `shared_files`. Resolve each overlap by adding to `shared_files` (if genuinely shared) or splitting/merging stories (if not). Re-run until zero illegal overlaps.

**4.5 Empty `shared_files` is forbidden for any plan with 2+ stories.**

---

**Step 5 — Compute waves and assign `wave: N` to each story:**

- Wave 1 = stories with `requires: []`.
- Wave N+1 = stories whose `requires` are entirely satisfied by waves ≤ N.
- Write the per-story `wave: N` field AND populate the top-level `waves:` block.

---

**Step 6 — Write `docs/plans/dependency-graph.yml`.**

---

**Step 7 — Final validation pass (BLOCKING — do all four checks manually):**

1. **Seed-wave check**: no two wave-1 stories list the same `shared_files` entry in their `files_touched`.
2. **Disjoint-files check**: for every pair of stories in the same wave, `files_touched` are disjoint modulo `shared_files`.
3. **Wave consistency check**: every story's `wave: N` field matches the wave it appears in inside the `waves:` block.
4. **Requires resolution check**: every story ID in any `requires` list exists in `stories:`.

---

**Step 8 — Add `## Dependency Graph` section to the TOP of `docs/plans/implementation-plan.md`** with a Mermaid `graph TD` mirror (color-coded by wave) + wave summary table.

---

**Step 9 — Show the graph + wave analysis to the user and confirm:**

```
📊 Dependency Graph
   - Total stories: K
   - Waves: W (largest wave = M independent stories)
   - Root-independent stories: R
   - Longest dependency chain: L stories deep
   - team_size: N → average wave width: K/W (target ≥ N)

⚠️ Flag any wave with fewer than `team_size` stories. Acceptable only if
   architecture genuinely forces it. Otherwise return to Step 3 and split.

Proceed to story file authoring? (yes / revise graph)
```

Block until the user confirms `yes`.

---

### Phase 2: Detail Each Story

For each story (whether Jira-sourced or local), follow `SPEC/templates/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_FORMAT.md` and include:

- [ ] **Must Read Reference Files** (images, specs, designs from `SPEC/references/`)
- [ ] **Design Tokens and Icons to Use** (for frontend stories — from `docs/ui-ux/ui-ux-spec.md` if exists)
- [ ] Epic context (Epic number, Story ID, Date, BUILDID if set, **Jira ID** if Jira-sourced)
- [ ] **Wave / Requires / Enables / Files Touched** in the story header — MUST mirror `docs/plans/dependency-graph.yml` exactly
- [ ] **Story Description** (detailed explanation of what the story does, what it achieves, and why it matters — placed at the top of the story; for Jira-sourced: use original Jira description and expand with additional context)
- [ ] Acceptance Criteria (comprehensive — cover every functional, edge-case, and validation scenario; include as many as needed to fully define "done"; for Jira-sourced: preserve original ACs from Jira, then add derived ones)
- [ ] Prerequisites (inferred from deep-dive module dependencies)
- [ ] Context files to read (exact paths from the codebase)
- [ ] Patterns to follow (from `docs/architecture/design/03-patterns-and-standards-brownfield.md` if it exists, otherwise from deep-dive pattern catalog — include migration notes for [New adoption] patterns where relevant)
- [ ] **Implementation Steps** (derived from target architecture + story description + AC, WITH code examples aligned to chosen patterns)
- [ ] **Test Requirements** (derived from existing test patterns, WITH code examples)
- [ ] Quality Checks (ESLint, coverage, etc.)
- [ ] Explicitly OUT of Scope (for Jira-sourced: preserve original out-of-scope from Jira, then add derived ones)
- [ ] Completion Evidence (what to provide when done)

**For Jira-sourced stories**: Keep original Jira title, description, AC, and out-of-scope unchanged. Add all derived fields (steps, tests, patterns, prerequisites) around them.

### Phase 3: Documentation

**NEVER write all stories into one file — generates too many tokens and will exceed output limits.**

- [ ] Create `docs/plans/implementation-plan.md` as **lean index only** (epic titles + story titles + one-line objectives — NO full story content)
- [ ] Add **QA Manual Testing Groups** section at the end of `implementation-plan.md` (see Output below)
- [ ] Create each story as an individual file **one at a time**: `docs/plans/stories/epic-N-story-N.M-Story-Title.md`
  - **Always this naming** — no build number in filename (build tracked inside story content)
  - Write one story → confirm and ask to continue with next story → write next story (never batch all stories in one response)
  - Story files MUST follow `SPEC/templates/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_FORMAT.md`
- [ ] Present index to user for approval before writing story files
- [ ] **After writing each story**, prompt:
  ```
  ✅ Story N.M written: docs/plans/stories/epic-N-story-N.M-<slug>.md
  Next? 1) Continue to next story  2) Edit this story  3) Stop
  ```
  - (1) Continue → write the next story.
  - (2) Edit → apply edits to the just-written story, then re-prompt the same 3 options.
  - (3) Stop → halt; do not write further stories.
- [ ] 🔴 **NEVER batch multiple stories in a single response** — exceeds token limits.

### Phase 4: Jira Sync (MANDATORY — Always ask, even if MCP not configured)

After user approves plan, check `docs/status.md` for the **Project Tracking** block:

- If `**Tracking**: Jira` → follow the **Jira path** below.
- If `**Tracking**: GitHub Projects` → follow the **GitHub path** (at the end of Phase 4).
- Otherwise → ask:
  ```
  ❓ Push stories to: 1) Jira   2) GitHub   3) Skip
  ```

#### Jira Path

#### 4.1 — Classify Stories by Origin

Scan all story files and split into two groups:
- **Jira-sourced stories**: Stories where `**Jira**:` is a real Jira ID (e.g., `PROJ-101`) — already exist in Jira
- **Local stories**: Stories where `**Jira**: LOCAL` — new, don't exist in Jira yet

```
📊 Story Origin Summary:

  🔗 Jira-sourced: [N] stories (already in Jira)
     [List: Story N.M → PROJ-101, Story N.M → PROJ-102, ...]

  🆕 Local: [M] stories (new — will be pushed to Jira)
     [List: Story N.M — [Title], Story N.M — [Title], ...]

Syncing to Jira...
```

#### 4.2 — Get Project Key

```
❓ Jira project key? (e.g., PROJ)
```

#### 4.3 — Sync Jira-Sourced Stories (Label + fixVersion Only)

For stories that already exist in Jira — **do NOT create duplicates**, just tag them:

```
@atlassian-rovo For each existing Jira issue:
- Add labels: epic-N, story-N.M, cycle-[N]
- Set `fixVersion` to `cycle-[N]` (e.g., cycle-1, cycle-2)
- Add comment: "Planned as Story N.M in AIRE implementation plan (BUILDID: CYCLE-N)"

Issues to update:
- PROJ-101 → labels: epic-1, story-1.1, cycle-1 | fixVersion: cycle-1
- PROJ-102 → labels: epic-1, story-1.2, cycle-1 | fixVersion: cycle-1
...
```

#### 4.4 — Push Local Stories to Jira (Full Export)

For new stories that don't exist in Jira — create them:

1. Get assignees: `@atlassian-rovo list assignable users [PROJECT_KEY]`
2. Ask: `Assign to: 1) Auto-distribute 2) One person 3) Unassigned 4) Manual`
3. Execute:
```
@atlassian-rovo Create in [PROJECT_KEY]:
- Epics with descriptions (only if epic doesn't already exist)
- Stories with full details (objective, AC, steps, tests)
- Labels: epic-N, story-N.M, cycle-[N], **wave-N** (read each story's `wave:` field from `docs/plans/dependency-graph.yml` — every story MUST carry exactly one `wave-N` label)
- Set `fixVersion` to `cycle-[N]` (e.g., cycle-1, cycle-2) on EVERY new story
- Assignees per config
- Story points (auto or blank)
```

**CRITICAL Jira Fix Version Rule**: When stories have a BUILDID (e.g., CYCLE-1), the corresponding Jira `fixVersion` MUST be `cycle-1` (lowercase, hyphenated). If the version does not exist in the Jira project, create it first.

4. Show summary: updated issues, new issues created, fixVersion applied, cycle labels applied

---

#### GitHub Path

> **Rule for the agent: execute every `gh` / `gh api` command yourself via the Bash tool. Do NOT ask the user. If 422 "already exists", skip and continue.**

**Step 1 — Read tracking context**

From `docs/status.md`: `ORG`, `REPO`, `PROJECT_NUMBER`, `PROJECT_ID`, `RELEASE_FIELD_ID`, `PRIORITY_FIELD_ID`, `STORY_POINTS_FIELD_ID`.
From active cycle plan: `RELEASE_OPTION_ID_CYCLE_N`.

**Step 2 — Classify stories by origin**

Scan each `docs/plans/stories/epic-N-story-N.M-*.md`:
- **Already-linked**: header has `**GitHub**: #<number>` → **update** path
- **New**: header has `**GitHub**: LOCAL` or no GitHub field → **create** path

Print counts:

```
🔗 Already-linked: N stories (will update labels/milestone/project)
🆕 New:            M stories (will create fresh GitHub issues)
```

**Step 3 — Ensure `epic:N` and `cycle:N` labels + Epic Milestones exist**

```bash
gh label create "epic:N" --color "6F42C1" --repo "ORG/REPO" --force --description "Epic N"
gh label create "cycle:N" --color "5319E7" --repo "ORG/REPO" --force

# Ensure wave labels — one per distinct wave in docs/plans/dependency-graph.yml:
# For each wave N referenced by any story:
gh label create "wave:N" --color "0E8A16" --repo "ORG/REPO" --force --description "Wave N — independent ready set"

gh api repos/ORG/REPO/milestones --method POST \
  -f title="Epic N: <Epic Name>" \
  -f description="<objective>" \
  -f due_on="<YYYY-MM-DD>T23:59:59Z"
# If 422, fetch existing milestone number:
gh api "repos/ORG/REPO/milestones?state=all" --jq '.[] | select(.title=="Epic N: <Epic Name>") | .number'
```

**Step 4a — CREATE path (new local stories)**

> **⚠️ CRITICAL — two failure modes that have silently burned past runs:**
>
> 1. **`--milestone` takes the milestone TITLE STRING, not the integer number.** `gh issue create --milestone 1` fails with "could not resolve to a Milestone" and the issue is NOT created. Always pass the full title (e.g. `--milestone "Epic 1: Project Foundation"`). The integer number captured from Step 3 is only for the REST API, not for `gh issue create` / `gh issue edit`.
> 2. **Never swallow the output of `gh issue create` into a variable without verifying both the exit code and that the captured value is a URL matching `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<number>`.** Whatever shell the agent is running in, some wrappers route `gh`'s error text to the same capture stream as the URL, and a surrounding print/log statement can exit 0 even when the issue was never created. After every call, assert: (a) exit status is 0, and (b) captured output matches the issue-URL pattern. On mismatch, STOP the loop — do not keep creating stories on top of a silent failure.

For each new story, run:

```bash
gh issue create --repo "ORG/REPO" \
  --title "Story N.M: <Title>" \
  --body "<AC + Prerequisites + Steps summary + Tests + Out of Scope + BUILDID: CYCLE-N>" \
  --label "story" --label "epic:N" --label "cycle:<N>" --label "wave:<W>" --label "<size>" --label "P<priority>" \
  --milestone "Epic N: <Epic Name>"
```

**Verify before continuing to the next story.** Two checks, in whichever shell the agent is using:

1. The exit status of `gh issue create` is 0.
2. The captured output matches `^https://github\.com/[^/]+/[^/]+/issues/\d+$`.

If either fails, STOP the loop and report the captured output verbatim. Only after both pass, extract the trailing `\d+` → `ISSUE_NUMBER`.

Then attach to the Project and set fields (same as greenfield Step 5):

```bash
ISSUE_ID=$(gh api "repos/ORG/REPO/issues/ISSUE_NUMBER" --jq '.node_id')

ITEM_ID=$(gh api graphql -f query='
mutation($projectId:ID!,$contentId:ID!){
  addProjectV2ItemById(input:{projectId:$projectId,contentId:$contentId}){ item{ id } }
}' -f projectId="PROJECT_ID" -f contentId="$ISSUE_ID" --jq '.data.addProjectV2ItemById.item.id')

gh api graphql -f query='
mutation($projectId:ID!,$itemId:ID!,$fieldId:ID!,$optionId:String!){
  updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue(input:{projectId:$projectId,itemId:$itemId,fieldId:$fieldId,value:{singleSelectOptionId:$optionId}}){ projectV2Item{ id } }
}' -f projectId="PROJECT_ID" -f itemId="$ITEM_ID" -f fieldId="RELEASE_FIELD_ID" -f optionId="RELEASE_OPTION_ID_CYCLE_N"
```

Update the story file header: `**GitHub**: LOCAL` → `**GitHub**: #ISSUE_NUMBER`.

**Step 4b — UPDATE path (already-linked stories)**

For each story with an existing `**GitHub**: #N`:

```bash
# Add labels + cycle + assign milestone (no duplicate issue)
gh issue edit N --repo "ORG/REPO" \
  --add-label "cycle:<N>" --add-label "epic:N" \
  --milestone "Epic N: <Epic Name>"

# Add comment
gh issue comment N --repo "ORG/REPO" \
  --body "Planned as Story N.M in AIRE implementation plan (BUILDID: CYCLE-N)"
```

If the issue is not yet on the project, add it + set Release field (same GraphQL as Step 4a).

**Step 5 — Summary**

Print: updated issues, new issues created, project URL, Release Plan option tagged.

---

### Phase 5: Update docs/status.md (MANDATORY)

- [ ] **Follow `SPEC/templates/STATUS_FORMAT.md`** — all fields/sections below must match that format
- [ ] Update `docs/status.md`:
  - **Updated By** → `PRODUCT_OWNER`
  - **Progress Summary** → Set "Implementation Plan" row to `✅ Done`, evidence: `docs/plans/implementation-plan.md`
  - **Current Step Details** → List all epics and story counts
  - **Completed Steps** → Add implementation plan with story count
  - **Upcoming** → First story to implement: `aire-dev-implement [N.M]`
  - **Build Cycles** table → Set **Stories** column to `0/[total]` for each cycle (count stories per BUILDID)
  - **Story Tracker** → Create and update table with one row per story (BUILDID, Story number, Title, Start: `—`, End: `—`)
  - **Agent Activity** → Update PRODUCT_OWNER to Idle

## Output

**Index** (`docs/plans/implementation-plan.md`): epic titles + story titles + one-line objectives


**QA Manual Testing Groups** — append as the last section in `implementation-plan.md`. Groups are ordered by **first testable milestone**, by epic. Every story appears in exactly one group — backend/API stories are listed as prerequisites (marked `[backend]`) inside the group that makes them manually testable, so QA can see the full picture and knows no stories were dropped.

Format:
```
## QA Manual Testing Groups

### Epic N: [Name]

**Group 1** — Stories: N.1 `[backend]`, N.2 `[backend]`, N.3
[Paragraph: once all stories in this group are done, QA can test X end-to-end. Mention what the backend stories provide (API, DB layer) and what the UI stories unlock. Describe the full user flow, what to verify, and any edge cases.]

**Group 2** — Stories: N.4, N.5
[Paragraph describing the combined test scenario.]
```

Rules:
- **Every story must appear in exactly one group** — no story is silently omitted
- **Groups never cross epic boundaries** — all stories in a group belong to the same epic
- Within an epic that has UI stories, backend/API stories are listed with `[backend]` alongside the UI stories they enable
- Keep descriptions concise — one paragraph per group; explain what the backend stories enable and what QA can verify end-to-end

**Story files** (`docs/plans/stories/epic-N-story-N.M-Story-Title.md`):
- Naming always `epic-N-story-N.M-Story-Title.md` — no build prefix in filename
- BUILDID tracked inside story header
- Written **one at a time** — never all in one response

---

## Mandatory Rules

Every story MUST include:
- Tests WITH code (never postponed)
- Run tests after EVERY story
- Update status with evidence
- Self-review document
- Epic review at epic end

---

## Rules

- 🔴 Measurable success criteria
- 🔴 Explicit scope boundaries
- 🔴 Reference existing patterns from deep-dive
- 🔴 NEVER write all stories in one response — exceeds token limits (one story per response, always)
- 🔴 After each story, ask: 1) Continue 2) Edit this story 3) Stop
- 🔴 Vertical slices only — no horizontal/layer-based epics

---

**Type "proceed" to generate implementation plan.**
