## Agent

**DEVOPS** 

## Before Starting

1. Read `SPEC/agents/AIRE_DEVOPS.md`
2. Read `SPEC/rulebooks/aire-devops-rulebook.md`
3. Read `docs/requirements.md` (if exists)
4. Read `docs/architecture/` (if exists)
5. Read `docs/plans/implementation-plan.md` (if exists)

---

## Execution Steps:

### Phase 0: DevOps Reference Check (MANDATORY FIRST)

**Check `SPEC/references/devops/` for existing infrastructure documentation before any discovery.**

1. **List Reference Directory**
   - [ ] List `SPEC/references/devops/`
   - [ ] Identify .docx, .pdf, .md, .txt, images, diagrams

2. **Process Documents**
   - [ ] For EACH .docx: `aire read SPEC/references/devops/<file>.docx`
   - [ ] For EACH .pdf: `aire read SPEC/references/devops/<file>.pdf`
   - [ ] If `aire read` fails: Ask user to run in CMD and paste output. **NEVER skip.**
   - [ ] Read .md/.txt files directly

3. **Process Images & Diagrams**
   - [ ] For EACH image in `SPEC/references/devops/` (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .svg, .webp): **View the image directly**
   - [ ] Note architecture diagrams, network topology, cloud resource layouts, deployment flow diagrams
   - [ ] Note environment structures (dev/staging/prod), service connections, data flows
   - [ ] Note any resource names, IP ranges, port numbers, or configurations visible in diagrams
   - [ ] If a diagram shows infrastructure that contradicts a text document, flag the conflict to the user

4. **Extract Pre-Existing Context**
   - [ ] Infrastructure architecture (cloud provider, regions, resource groups, networking)
   - [ ] Existing resource names, SKUs, configurations
   - [ ] Deployment pipeline designs or requirements
   - [ ] Security/compliance requirements
   - [ ] Module selections or preferences already specified
   - [ ] Operator IP addresses or network access policies

5. **Confirm**
   - [ ] Tell user: "Found [N] documents and [M] images in SPEC/references/devops/"
   - [ ] List what was found and key details extracted
   - [ ] Note: values from reference docs will be **pre-filled** in discovery questions — user confirms or overrides

> **Rules**:
> - 🔴 NEVER skip .docx/.pdf — use `aire read` or ask user to run in CMD
> - 🔴 NEVER skip images — view ALL .png/.jpg/.jpeg/.gif/.svg/.webp files directly
> - 🔴 NEVER proceed without reading ALL reference documents and viewing ALL images
> - 🔴 Reference doc values are pre-filled as defaults in discovery questions — user MUST confirm or override each one
> - 🔴 If reference doc and user answer conflict, user answer wins — note "user-overridden" in report

---

### Phase 0.5: Tracker Story Integration

**Ask the user if they have an existing DevOps task/story on their tracker board.**

First check `docs/status.md` → `## Project Tracking` block. Use `**Tracking**:` value to pre-filter options (offer only paths that match the active tracker; if neither or both, show all).

```
📋 How would you like to start?

[J] I have a DevOps task/story in Jira I want to work on
[G] I have a DevOps issue in GitHub I want to work on
[S] I want to work from scratch — no tracker story

Choose J, G, or S:
```

---

#### PATH J: Work from Jira Story

##### J.1 — Fetch Story Details

Ask user:
```
❓ Paste the Jira story URL(s) — one per line:
   Example: https://your-org.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123
```

For each URL provided:
1. Extract the issue key from the URL (e.g., `PROJ-123`)
2. Use `@atlassian-rovo get issue [ISSUE-KEY]` to fetch full details
3. Extract: Story ID, Title, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Priority, Status

##### J.2 — Check Story Completeness

**A DevOps story is COMPLETE if it has ALL of**:
- [ ] **Description** — clear objective (what infrastructure/pipeline work and why)
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria** — at least 1-2 items (e.g., "Pipeline deploys to staging on merge to main")

**A story is INCOMPLETE if ANY of the above is missing or too vague to act on.**

Report:
```
📊 Story Completeness Analysis:

[For each story]
Story [JIRA-ID]: [Title]
Status: ✅ COMPLETE / ⚠️ INCOMPLETE
Missing: [Description / Acceptance Criteria — whichever apply]
```

##### J.3 — Complete Incomplete Stories

For each **INCOMPLETE** story, ask clarifying questions grounded in what you know about the project:

```
❓ Clarifying Questions for [JIRA-ID]: [Title]

This story is missing: [Description / Acceptance Criteria].

[If Description missing or vague:]
1. What is the goal of this DevOps story? What infrastructure/pipeline work needs to happen and why?

[If AC missing or too vague:]
2. What does "done" look like? Give me 2-3 specific outcomes.
   (e.g., "CI pipeline runs lint + test + security scan on every PR")

Please answer so I can proceed with discovery.
```

After user answers, all fields are now known. Repeat for ALL incomplete stories before proceeding.

##### J.4 — Record Jira Context

- [ ] Note the Jira story ID(s) for inclusion in the discovery report
- [ ] Use the story description and AC to pre-inform the discovery questions (pre-fill answers where the story provides enough detail)
- [ ] Proceed to Phase 1 with Jira context loaded

---

#### PATH G: Work from GitHub Issue

> **Rule for the agent: run every `gh` / `gh api` command yourself via the Bash tool. Do NOT ask the user. If 422 "already exists", skip and continue.**

##### G.1 — Fetch Issue Details

Ask user:
```
❓ Paste the GitHub issue URL(s) or `#N` number(s) — one per line:
   Example: https://github.com/ORG/REPO/issues/42   or   #42
```

From `docs/status.md` Project Tracking block, capture `ORG`, `REPO`, `PROJECT_NUMBER`, `PROJECT_ID`, `STATUS_FIELD_ID`.

For each issue:

```bash
gh issue view N --repo "ORG/REPO" --json number,title,body,state,labels,milestone,assignees,url
```

Extract: Issue number, Title, Body (User Story + Acceptance Criteria), Labels, Milestone, Current board Status (from `gh project item-list PROJECT_NUMBER --owner ORG --format json` matched by issue number).

##### G.2 — Check Issue Completeness

**A DevOps issue is COMPLETE if it has ALL of**:
- [ ] **Description / User Story** — clear objective (what infrastructure/pipeline work and why)
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria** — at least 1-2 items (e.g., "Pipeline deploys to staging on merge to main")

**INCOMPLETE if missing or too vague.**

Report:
```
📊 Issue Completeness Analysis:

[For each issue]
Issue #N: [Title]
Status: ✅ COMPLETE / ⚠️ INCOMPLETE
Missing: [Description / AC — whichever apply]
```

##### G.3 — Complete Incomplete Issues

For each **INCOMPLETE** issue, ask the same clarifying questions used in J.3. After the user answers, **append the clarification to the issue body** so future readers see it:

```bash
gh issue comment N --repo "ORG/REPO" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
### Clarification (captured during aire-devops-discover)

**Goal**: <user answer>

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- <AC 1>
- <AC 2>
EOF
)"
```

##### G.4 — Record GitHub Context

- [ ] Note the issue numbers for inclusion in the discovery report
- [ ] Use body + AC to pre-inform discovery questions
- [ ] Proceed to Phase 1 with GitHub context loaded

---

#### PATH S: Work from Scratch

- [ ] Proceed directly to Phase 1 — no tracker context
- [ ] At the end of this workflow (Phase 5), user will be offered to create/link a tracker story (Jira or GitHub, depending on active tracker)

---

### Phase 1: Auto-Detect Application Profile

Scan the codebase and extract all available information BEFORE asking any questions:

- [ ] **Auto-detect language and framework** by scanning for manifest files:

  | Language | Manifest Files | Framework Detection |
  |----------|---------------|---------------------|
  | Python | `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Pipfile` | Django, Flask, FastAPI from imports/deps |
  | Node.js/TypeScript | `package.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `tsconfig.json` | React, Next.js, Express, NestJS, Angular, Vue from deps |
  | Java/Kotlin | `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `build.gradle.kts` | Spring Boot, Quarkus, Micronaut from deps |
  | .NET/C# | `*.csproj`, `*.sln`, `global.json` | ASP.NET Core, Blazor from SDK/packages |
  | Go | `go.mod`, `go.sum` | Gin, Echo, Fiber from imports |
  | Rust | `Cargo.toml` | Actix, Axum, Rocket from deps |
  | Ruby | `Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock` | Rails, Sinatra from gems |
  | PHP | `composer.json` | Laravel, Symfony from deps |

- [ ] Detect language version (e.g., `.python-version`, `.nvmrc`, `.node-version`, `.tool-versions`, `runtime.txt`, `global.json`, `go.mod`)
- [ ] Detect build, test, lint, start commands from manifest `scripts` section or convention
- [ ] Scan for existing `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.dockerignore`
- [ ] Scan for existing `.github/workflows/`
- [ ] Detect database dependencies (psycopg2, pymongo, sqlalchemy, etc.)
- [ ] Detect external service dependencies (redis, celery, elasticsearch, etc.)
- [ ] Detect environment variable requirements from `.env.example`, `.env.template`, or settings files
- [ ] Read `docs/architecture/` for system design context
- [ ] Read `docs/requirements.md` for project requirements
- [ ] **Check for existing `variables.tf`** — if found, read it and flag any unclear/ambiguous variable names for user clarification (RULE T8)

### Phase 2: Present Auto-Detection Results

- [ ] **If nothing detected**: Say "No application code detected in this workspace — skipping auto-detection." and proceed directly to Phase 3 discovery questions. Do NOT ask the user to clarify the workspace, project type, or whether code exists — just move on.
- [ ] **If results found**: Show user a summary table of everything detected
- [ ] Highlight any conflicts or uncertainties (e.g., multiple frameworks detected)
- [ ] Note what could NOT be auto-detected
- [ ] If `variables.tf` found, present its variables and ask user to clarify ambiguous names (e.g., `var.name` → "What does this refer to?")

### Phase 3: Ask Discovery Questions

**Ask ONLY questions not answered by auto-detection. Follow this exact order.**

**Step 1 — Deployment Model (MUST ASK FIRST):**
1. **Server-based or Serverless?**
2. If **server-based**: Where? (AWS EC2, Azure VM, DigitalOcean, bare-metal Linux, self-managed K8s on VMs, etc.)
3. If **serverless**: Which platform? (AWS Lambda, ECS Fargate, App Runner, Azure Functions, Azure Container Apps, GCP Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, GKE Autopilot, etc.)

> **RULE DM1**: If the user's chosen category does not match the service they named, **correct them before proceeding** (e.g., "ECS Fargate is serverless, not server-based — you don't manage servers"). Wrong classification changes the entire deployment architecture.
**Step 2 — Infrastructure Naming & Core Parameters (MUST ASK — COLLECT ONCE, USE EVERYWHERE):**

> **CRITICAL**: These values are asked ONCE and used consistently across ALL Terraform files, pipelines, Docker configs. NEVER auto-generate names. Questions are **branched by cloud provider** — only ask what applies to the platform chosen in Step 1.

4. **Project/App name prefix** for all resource naming (e.g., `myapp`) — used to derive ALL resource names consistently across every cloud provider
5. **Region / Location** (e.g., Azure: `eastus`, AWS: `eu-west-1`, GCP: `us-central1`)

6. **Does networking already exist?** (VPC/VNet, subnets, security groups/NSGs) — or should Terraform create them?
   - If **already exists**: provide names/IDs — Terraform will reference them via `data` sources, NOT recreate
   - If **create new**: provide desired names — Terraform will create them as `resource` blocks

**If Azure:**
7. **Resource Group name** (e.g., `rg-myapp-prod`) — already exists or create new?
8. **VNet name** (e.g., `vnet-myapp-prod`)
9. **Subnet name(s)** — how many and what names? (e.g., `snet-app`, `snet-db`)

**If AWS:**
7. **VPC name or ID** (e.g., `vpc-myapp-prod` or `vpc-0abc123`)
8. **Subnet name(s) or IDs** — how many, which AZs, public/private? (e.g., `subnet-app-a`, `subnet-db-b`)
9. **AWS Account ID** (if multi-account strategy) — or confirm single-account

**If GCP:**
7. **GCP Project ID** (e.g., `myapp-prod-123456`) — GCP's organizational container (NOT the same as the app name prefix above)
8. **VPC name** (e.g., `vpc-myapp-prod`)
9. **Subnet name(s)** — how many and what names? (e.g., `subnet-app`, `subnet-db`)

**All providers:**
10. **Environment name(s)** — which environments? (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`)

**Step 3 — Service Module Selection (MUST ASK):**

> Ask which infrastructure modules the user wants. Present in TWO parts: core modules first, then optional modules separately. For EACH selected module, ask for the **exact resource name**. Do NOT assume defaults.

**Part A — Core Modules** (ask which ones they need):

9. Which core infrastructure modules do you need? (select all that apply):
   - **Compute / App Hosting** (Azure App Service, AWS ECS/EB, GCP Cloud Run/App Engine — frontend + backend together as single module) — name?
   - **Database** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, CosmosDB, DynamoDB, Cloud Spanner, etc.) — type and name?
   - **Cache** (Redis, Memcached — managed or self-hosted) — name?
   - **Message Queue** (Service Bus, SQS/SNS, Pub/Sub, RabbitMQ, Kafka) — name?
   - **Storage** (Azure Blob/ADLS, AWS S3, GCP Cloud Storage) — account/bucket name?
   - **Container Registry** (ACR, ECR, Artifact Registry, Docker Hub) — name?
   - **Monitoring** (Azure Monitor/App Insights, CloudWatch, GCP Cloud Monitoring, Datadog, Grafana) — name?
   - **Secrets Manager** (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager/SSM, GCP Secret Manager) — name?
   - **Other** — describe

**Part B — Optional Modules** (ask explicitly, one by one):

10. Do you want a **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**? (Azure WAF, AWS WAF, GCP Cloud Armor) Adds Layer 7 security with OWASP protection, bot mitigation, rate limiting at edge. Adds cost + complexity — recommended only for public-facing apps. (yes/no) — if yes, what name?
11. Do you want **Private DNS Zones**? (Azure Private DNS, AWS Route 53 Private Hosted Zones, GCP Cloud DNS Private Zones) Required for private endpoint name resolution within your VPC/VNet. (yes/no) — if yes, which zone names?

> **Rule**: NEVER include optional modules unless the user explicitly says "yes". Silence or ambiguity = do NOT include.

**Part C — Out-of-Scope Resources (NEVER BUILD):**

Inform the user that the following integration/orchestration services are permanently out of scope. Do NOT create them in ANY module:

| Azure | AWS | GCP | Status |
|-------|-----|-----|--------|
| Storage Queues | SWF | Workflows | 🚫 Out of scope |
| Private Endpoint: Queue | Data Pipeline (legacy) | — | 🚫 Out of scope |
| ADF Diagnostic Settings | — | — | 🚫 Out of scope |
| Logic Apps | — | — | 🚫 Out of scope |

> If the user requests any of these, inform them these are outside the DevOps agent's scope.

**Step 3.5 — Per-Module Configuration Details (MUST ASK — for EACH selected module):**

> For EVERY module the user selected in Step 3, ask the relevant configuration questions below. Do NOT ask questions for modules the user did not select. If a reference document (PDF, PRD) was provided that already specifies these details, still VALIDATE them with the user before including in the report.

**Database (only if Database selected in Step 3):**

> The user already specified the database TYPE in Step 3 (PostgreSQL, MySQL, CosmosDB, SQL Server, MongoDB, etc.). Ask the config questions that match their chosen type. Questions are grouped by database family — only ask the relevant group.

**Common to ALL message queue types:**

- [ ] Expected message volume? (messages/second or messages/day — affects SKU and partition sizing)

> **Rule**: For each selected module, collect authentication mode, SKU/tier, runtime version, network access, identity type, app settings, and linked service connections. Never assume defaults without asking. If user says "use defaults" for a specific question, document it as "user-accepted default" in the report.

**Common to ALL network-restricted resources (MUST ASK if ANY module above uses `default_action = Deny`, `public_network_access = disabled`, or firewall rules):**

> **CRITICAL**: When ANY resource restricts network access, the Terraform runner and operators are ALSO blocked unless their IPs are whitelisted. Collect these ONCE and apply to ALL network-restricted resources.

- [ ] **Operator/admin public IP addresses**: List ALL public IPs that need to manage these resources from outside the cloud network:
  - Developer laptop IPs (for running `terraform apply` locally, browsing Key Vault secrets, managing storage, etc.)
  - CI/CD runner IPs (GitHub Actions runner IPs, GitLab runner IPs, self-hosted agent IPs)
  - Any VPN or bastion host egress IPs
  - Example format: `["203.0.113.10/32", "198.51.100.0/24"]`
- [ ] These IPs will be added to `ip_rules` / `firewall_rules` on ALL resources with network restrictions (Key Vault, Storage, SQL Server, Container Registry, Cache, etc.)
- [ ] If CI/CD uses dynamic IPs (e.g., GitHub-hosted runners), recommend alternatives: self-hosted runners with static IPs, private endpoints, or VNet integration for the CI runner
- [ ] **Include these IPs in the discovery report** under a dedicated "Operator Network Access" section

> **Rule**: If any module has network_acls `default_action = Deny` and operator IPs are empty or not asked, **STOP** and ask — empty `ip_rules` with `default_action = Deny` will lock out Terraform itself.

**Step 4 — Service Interdependency Mapping (MUST ASK):**

12. Which services depend on which? (e.g., "App needs DB and Redis before starting")
13. Any services that must be deployed BEFORE others? (e.g., DB migrations before app)
14. Any shared resources between services? (e.g., both FE and BE share same DB)

> Build a dependency graph from answers. Validate no circular dependencies.

**Step 5 — Infrastructure & Access Details (MUST ASK — branched by deployment model from Step 1):**

**If server-based:**
15. Server access: IP/hostname + SSH user + PEM key path OR cloud credentials profile
16. Target OS? (Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, etc.)
17. Single server or multi-server?

**If serverless:**
15. Cloud credentials profile or service principal for deployment?
16. Service/function names if reusing existing? (e.g., existing ECS cluster, Cloud Run service, Lambda function names)

**All deployment models:**
17. Do you have a domain name? (**Note: DNS will be configured manually by the user**)
18. Production secrets or `.env` variables not in codebase?

**Step 6 — Application Profile (ASK IF NOT AUTO-DETECTED):**
20. VCS/CI platform: GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket?
21. What port(s) does the backend run on?
22. Any custom build command?
23. Any custom start command?

**Step 7 — Deployment Strategy (MUST ASK — branched by deployment model from Step 1):**

**If server-based:**
24. Deployment method: Docker Compose, PM2, Systemd, self-managed Kubernetes?

**If serverless:**
24. Deployment method: Cloud CLI (`sam deploy`, `az functionapp deploy`, `gcloud run deploy`), Terraform only, or framework deploy (`serverless deploy`, Copilot, etc.)?

**All deployment models:**
25. Git repository URL?
26. Branch strategy? (`main → prod` / `main → staging → prod` / `feature → dev → staging → prod`)
27. Zero-downtime deployments? (blue-green, rolling update, canary, traffic shifting)
28. **Do you want CI/CD pipelines created?** (yes/no) — if no, only IaC and deployment configs will be generated, no pipeline files

**Step 8 — Monitoring & Ops (RECOMMENDED):**
28. Health check endpoint? (e.g., `/health`)
29. Log management preference? (CloudWatch, Grafana, file-based)
30. Monitoring/alerting requirements?

**Step 9 — DevSecOps Tooling (RECOMMENDED):**

> Security scanning tools integrate into your CI pipeline. Some are free/no-config, others need accounts and tokens.

**Part A — Auto-included (free, no config needed — inform user, don't ask):**

Tell the user these will be added automatically:
- **Secret Scanning** (gitleaks) — detects leaked secrets in code. Free, runs in CI, no setup.
- **Container Scanning** (Trivy) — finds vulnerabilities in Docker images. Free, runs in CI, no setup. *(Only if Dockerfile detected)*

**Part B — SAST / Code Quality (ASK):**

31. Do you want **static code analysis** (SAST) for code quality + security vulnerabilities? Options:
   - **SonarQube** (self-hosted) — needs server URL, token, project key
   - **SonarCloud** (hosted) — needs org name, token, project key
   - **Semgrep** (free tier available) — needs token for paid rules, free rules work without
   - **CodeQL** (free for public repos on GitHub) — no external config needed
   - **None** — skip SAST

32. If SonarQube/SonarCloud selected:
   - **Project Key** — unique identifier for this project in SonarQube?
   - **Organization** (SonarCloud only)?
   - Any **file/folder exclusions** from scanning? (e.g., `**/migrations/**`, `**/tests/**`)

**Part C — Dependency Scanning / SCA (ASK):**

33. For **dependency vulnerability scanning** (SCA), which approach?
   - **Dependabot** (GitHub only, free, auto-PRs) — no config needed
   - **pip-audit / safety** (free, runs in CI) — no config needed
   - **Snyk** (needs token, richer reporting)
   - **None** — skip SCA

**Part D — Dynamic Analysis / DAST (ASK — advanced):**

34. Do you want **dynamic application security testing** (DAST)? This tests a running app for vulnerabilities. Adds complexity — needs a running environment in CI.
   - **OWASP ZAP** (free) — needs target URL in CI
   - **None** — skip DAST *(recommended unless you have specific compliance needs)*

> **Rule**: Auto-include Part A tools. For Parts B/C/D, only include what the user explicitly selects. Silence = skip.

- [ ] Wait for ALL user responses before proceeding
- [ ] Clarify any ambiguous answers

### Phase 4: Generate Discovery Report

- [ ] Compile all auto-detected + user-provided information
- [ ] Include **infrastructure naming table** — every resource name as provided by user
- [ ] Include **per-module configuration table** for each selected module — auth mode, SKU/tier, runtime version, network access, identity type, app settings, linked services, and all platform-specific config collected in Step 3.5
- [ ] If reference documents from `SPEC/references/devops/` provided module configs, include them with source attribution — note "from [filename], validated by user" or "from [filename], user-overridden" next to each value
- [ ] Include **service dependency graph** with startup order
- [ ] Include **selected modules** with user-provided names
- [ ] Include note: "DNS configuration: Manual — required records will be documented in runbook"
- [ ] Include **DevSecOps tooling selections** — which tools selected, config values collected (project keys, orgs, exclusions), auto-included tools noted
- [ ] If existing `variables.tf` was found, include clarified variable mappings
- [ ] Create `docs/deployment/discovery-report.md`
- [ ] Get user confirmation on accuracy

---

### Phase 5: Tracker Story Management

**After the discovery report is approved, manage tracker story tracking. Route by the path the user took in Phase 0.5 and by `docs/status.md` Project Tracking.**

#### If user started with Jira stories (PATH J):

- [ ] Ask user:

```
📋 Jira Story Update

Your discovery report references these Jira stories:
  [List JIRA-IDs and titles]

Would you like to transition them?
  [P] Mark as In Progress
  [N] Move to next status (e.g., In Review, Ready for Dev)
  [S] Skip — don't update Jira status

Choose P, N, or S:
```

- [ ] If P or N: Use `@atlassian-rovo` to transition the issue:
  1. `@atlassian-rovo get transitions for issue [JIRA-ID]` — get available transitions
  2. `@atlassian-rovo transition issue [JIRA-ID]` to the selected status
  3. Confirm transition to user

#### If user started from scratch (PATH S):

- [ ] Ask user:

```
📋 Jira Story Tracking

Would you like to create a Jira story for this DevOps work?
  [C] Yes — create a new story on my Jira board
  [L] I'll link an existing story — let me paste URL(s)
  [S] Skip — no Jira tracking needed

Choose C, L, or S:
```

- [ ] If C: Ask for Jira project key, then create a story using `@atlassian-rovo create issue in project [PROJECT_KEY]`:
  - Title: derived from discovery report summary (e.g., "DevOps: Set up CI/CD and infrastructure for [project]")
  - Description: link to discovery report, key decisions made
  - Record the created story ID in the discovery report

- [ ] If L: Ask for URL(s), extract issue keys, record in discovery report. Ask if they want to mark as In Progress (same flow as PATH J above).

- [ ] If S: Skip — no Jira tracking.

#### Update Discovery Report with Jira Story Numbers

- [ ] If Jira stories are linked (from PATH J or Phase 5), add a **"Jira Stories"** section to `docs/deployment/discovery-report.md`:

```markdown
## Jira Stories

| Jira ID | Title | Status | URL |
|---------|-------|--------|-----|
| PROJ-123 | Set up CI/CD pipeline | In Progress | https://your-org.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123 |
| PROJ-124 | Configure staging environment | In Progress | https://your-org.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-124 |
```

- [ ] This section will be read by downstream workflows (`aire-devops-pipeline`, `aire-devops-deploy`) to update Jira story status upon completion.

#### Update docs/status.md

- [ ] Update `docs/status.md` per `SPEC/templates/STATUS_FORMAT.md`: Set "DevOps Discovery" row to `✅ Done`, evidence: `docs/deployment/discovery-report.md`

---

---

## Rules

- 🔴 CHECK `SPEC/references/devops/` FIRST — read ALL reference docs before discovery. Use `aire read` for .docx/.pdf. NEVER skip.
- 🔴 AUTO-DETECT before asking — never ask what can be found in code
- 🔴 ASK SERVERLESS VS SERVER first — determines entire architecture
- 🔴 COLLECT INFRA NAMING ONCE — resource group, region, VNet, subnet, prefix asked once, used everywhere
- 🔴 NEVER AUTO-GENERATE NAMES — every resource name comes from user input
- 🔴 ASK MODULE SELECTION — user chooses which modules and provides exact names
- 🔴 ASK PER-MODULE CONFIG — for every selected module, ask authentication mode, SKU/tier, runtime version, network access, identity type, app settings, and linked service connections. Branch questions by platform (Azure/AWS/GCP) and by service type variant. Never assume defaults without asking.
- 🔴 VALIDATE REFERENCE DOCS — if `SPEC/references/devops/` docs provided module configs, pre-fill in questions but still confirm each value with user. User answer wins on conflict.
- 🔴 MAP INTERDEPENDENCIES — build service dependency graph, validate no circular deps
- 🔴 READ VARIABLES.TF — if exists, read and ask user to clarify unclear names (RULE T8)
- 🔴 DNS IS MANUAL — never auto-configure DNS; document required records only
- 🔴 SINGLE APP MODULE — frontend + backend are ONE App Service module, never separate
- 🔴 WAF IS OPTIONAL — only include if user explicitly requests
- 🔴 AUTO-INCLUDE gitleaks and Trivy (if Docker) — no user choice needed
- 🔴 SAST/SCA/DAST tools only if user explicitly selects — silence = skip
- 🔴 ASK all must-ask questions — never assume deployment target
- 🔴 WAIT for user responses — never proceed without answers
- 🔴 No secrets in discovery report — reference names only, no values
- 🔴 If ANY module uses network_acls `default_action = Deny` or disables public access, MUST collect operator/admin IPs — empty `ip_rules` with Deny locks out Terraform and operators
- 🔴 Get user CONFIRMATION on discovery report before next phase
- 🔴 ASK JIRA FIRST — ask user if they have a Jira story or want to work from scratch before starting discovery
- 🔴 CHECK JIRA STORY COMPLETENESS — if Jira story provided, verify Description and Acceptance Criteria exist; ask clarifying questions for missing fields
- 🔴 JIRA STORIES IN REPORT — if Jira stories linked, include "Jira Stories" section in discovery report with story IDs, titles, status, and URLs
- 🔴 OFFER JIRA TRANSITION — after discovery report approval, offer to mark Jira stories as In Progress or next status
- 🔴 OFFER JIRA CREATION — if user started from scratch, offer to create a Jira story after discovery report is approved
