# Greenfield - Requirements Definition

## Agent

**ANALYST_PM_GREENFIELD** 

## Before Starting

1. Read `SPEC/agents/AIRE_ANALYST_PM_GREENFIELD.md`
2. Read `SPEC/rulebooks/aire-greenfield-rulebook.md`
3. Read `docs/status.md` — if missing, **STOP**: Tell user to "Run `aire-project-kickoff` first."
3. **MANDATORY**: Check `SPEC/references/` - run `aire read` for .docx/.pdf (use CMD on Windows)
4. **IF FAILS**: Ask user to run in CMD and paste output

---
  
## What I Need From You

1. **What are we building?**
2. **Who is it for?**
3. **What problem does it solve?**
4. **What does success look like?**
5. **Any constraints?** (Timeline, tech, budget)
6. **MVP, PoC, or Production-ready?**

---
## Reference Document Adherence (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS check `SPEC/references/` first before any workflow. Reference documents represent approved decisions and are the absolute source of truth. Treat them as requirements, not suggestions.**

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🔴 **STRICTLY FOLLOW** | Execute the vision exactly as specified. |
| 🔴 **NO CHANGES** | Do not suggest modifications to existing feature definitions. |
| 🔴 **NO ALTERNATIVES** | Do not propose alternative approaches unless explicitly asked. |
| 🔴 **CLARIFY ONLY** | Only ask about genuinely ambiguous points. |
| 🔴 **IMPLEMENT, DON'T REDESIGN**| Your job is execution, not re-architecture. |
| 🔴 **NEVER SKIP FILES** | Never skip `.docx`/`.pdf` files — use `aire read` or ask the user to run it. |
| 🔴 **READ ALL FIRST** | NEVER proceed without reading ALL references. |

---

## Execution Steps:

#### Phase 0: Reference Check (MANDATORY FIRST)

**Execute these steps sequentially before gathering new requirements:**

- [ ] **List Directory:** List all files in `SPEC/references/`.
- [ ] **Process Documents:** - For `.docx`/`.pdf`: Run `aire read SPEC/references/<file>` (if it fails, ask the user to run it in CMD and paste the output).
  - For `.md`/`.txt`: Read directly.
- [ ] **Process Designs:** View images/designs and document them in `docs/requirements.md` under the "Design References" section, noting key UI/UX elements.
- [ ] **Process Builds (`SPEC/references/builds/`):**
  - Run `aire read` for `.docx`/`.pdf`; read others directly.
  - **⚠️ CRITICAL:** Build docs represent the product release plan for this greenfield project. They do NOT mean the project already exists. **Do NOT switch to brownfield.**
  - **If builds are found**, infer the sequence from filenames (e.g., numeric/alpha prefixes).
  - Present to the user: `📦 Found [N] builds: [list with 1-line summaries]. Suggested order: Build 1→2→N. Confirm or reorder?`
  - Record the confirmed sequence in `docs/requirements.md` under "Build Sequence". *(Note: This sequence will drive epic/story grouping in implementation planning).*
- [ ] **Confirm Status:** Confirm to the user exactly what was found and successfully read before moving to Phase 1.

#### Phase 1: Discovery

1. **Understand the Vision**
   - [ ] What are we building?
   - [ ] What problem does it solve?
   - [ ] Who are the target users?
   - [ ] What is the business value?

2. **Ask Fundamental Questions**
   - [ ] What does success look like?
   - [ ] What would make this fail?
   - [ ] What are the non-negotiable constraints?
   - [ ] What is the timeline?
   - [ ] What is the quality expectation? (MVP/PoC/Production)

3. **Define Project Type**
   - [ ] MVP (Proof of Concept acceptable)
   - [ ] Production-Ready (NO shortcuts)
   - [ ] Internal Tool vs Customer-Facing
   - [ ] Timeline (days/weeks/months)

4. **Gather Technical Constraints**
   - [ ] Required technologies (if any)
   - [ ] Infrastructure constraints
   - [ ] Integration requirements
   - [ ] Security requirements
   - [ ] Performance requirements

#### Phase 2: Requirements Analysis

5. **Define Success Criteria**
   For each criterion:
   - [ ] Is it specific? (Not vague)
   - [ ] Is it measurable? (Objective test)
   - [ ] Is it achievable? (Within constraints)
   - [ ] Is it relevant? (Ties to goal)
   - [ ] Is it time-bound? (Has deadline)

6. **Define Failure Criteria**
   - [ ] What outcomes are unacceptable?
   - [ ] What would cause project failure?
   - [ ] What quality is non-negotiable?

7. **Define Quality Gates**
   - [ ] Test coverage requirements
   - [ ] Performance benchmarks
   - [ ] Security requirements
   - [ ] Documentation requirements

8. **Define Explicit Scope**
   - [ ] List everything IN scope
   - [ ] List everything explicitly OUT of scope
   - [ ] Identify scope boundaries
   - [ ] Get user confirmation on scope

#### Phase 3: Documentation

9. **Confirm Understanding**
   - [ ] Summarize all requirements back to user
   - [ ] State all assumptions explicitly
   - [ ] Get user approval before documenting

10. **Create Requirements Document**
    - [ ] Project overview
    - [ ] Success criteria (measurable)
    - [ ] Failure criteria (explicit)
    - [ ] Technical constraints
    - [ ] Quality gates
    - [ ] Explicit scope
    - [ ] Timeline and milestones

11. **Request Approval**
    - [ ] Present document to user
    - [ ] Address any questions
    - [ ] Get formal approval

12. Create `docs/requirements.md`
 

### Phase 4: Update docs/status.md (MANDATORY)

- [ ] **Read `SPEC/templates/STATUS_FORMAT.md`** — mandatory format for status.md
- [ ] Read existing `docs/status.md`
- [ ] Updates to make:
  - **Updated By** → `ANALYST_PM_GREENFIELD`
  - **Overall Status** → `🟡 IN PROGRESS`
  - **Progress Summary** → Set "Requirements" row to `✅ Done` with evidence: `docs/requirements.md`
  - **Current Step Details** → Mark all requirements phases complete
  - **Completed Steps** → Add requirements with evidence: `docs/requirements.md`
  - **Upcoming** → `aire-greenfield-architecture`
  - **Agent Activity** → Update ANALYST_PM_GREENFIELD to Idle

Report to user:
```
✅ docs/status.md updated
   Step: Requirements → ✅ Done
   Next: Run aire-greenfield-architecture
```
