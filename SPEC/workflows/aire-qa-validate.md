# QA - Validate Implementation



## Agent

**QA** 

## Before Starting

1. Read `SPEC/agents/AIRE_QA.md`
2. Read `SPEC/rulebooks/aire-qa-rulebook.md`
3. Read `docs/requirements.md`

---

## Tell Me the Scope

**IMPORTANT**: Always ask the user to choose the scope before proceeding.

Present these options:

```
What scope should be validated?

📋 FULL IMPLEMENTATION:
  1. "full" - Validate entire implementation (uses test-plan-full.md)

📦 EPIC-LEVEL:
  2. "epic [N]" - Validate a specific epic (uses test-plan-epic-[N].md)

📝 STORY-LEVEL:
  3. "story [N.M]" - Validate a specific story (uses test-plan-story-[N.M].md)

Type your choice:
```

Based on the user's choice, set:
- **Scope**: `full` | `epic-[N]` | `story-[N.M]`
- **Input test plan**:
  - full → `docs/testing/test-plan-full.md`
  - epic → `docs/testing/test-plan-epic-[N].md`
  - story → `docs/testing/test-plan-story-[N.M].md`
- **Output file**:
  - full → `docs/testing/validation-report-full-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`
  - epic → `docs/testing/validation-report-epic-[N]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`
  - story → `docs/testing/validation-report-story-[N.M]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

**If the corresponding test plan does not exist**, inform the user:
```
⚠️ No test plan found for [scope].
Run aire-qa-test-plan first to create: docs/testing/test-plan-[scope].md

Would you like to:
1. Create the test plan first (run aire-qa-test-plan)
2. Proceed without a test plan (not recommended)
```

## Execution Steps:

### Phase 1: Pre-Validation Checks
- [ ] Read the input test plan for chosen scope
- [ ] Read `docs/requirements.md` — identify requirements in scope
- [ ] Confirm all implementation steps are complete for the scope
- [ ] Identify test commands/scripts to run
- [ ] Confirm code is committed

### Phase 2: Test Execution
- [ ] Run unit tests — capture full output
- [ ] Run integration tests — capture full output
- [ ] Run E2E tests (if applicable) — capture full output
- [ ] Generate coverage reports
- [ ] Capture logs as evidence

### Phase 3: Requirements Verification
- [ ] For each requirement in scope: verify at least one passing test
- [ ] Document evidence per requirement
- [ ] Identify any gaps in coverage

### Phase 4: Quality Gate Verification
- [ ] Unit test coverage ≥85%
- [ ] All integration tests passing (100%)
- [ ] 0 critical bugs open
- [ ] ≤2 high bugs (with workarounds)
- [ ] Security scan passed (if applicable)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (if applicable)

### Phase 5: Functional Testing
- [ ] Happy path scenarios from test plan
- [ ] Edge cases from test plan
- [ ] Error handling scenarios
- [ ] Integration points

### Phase 6: Non-Functional Testing (if applicable)
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Security testing
- [ ] Accessibility testing
- [ ] Browser compatibility

---

### Phase 7: Issue Identification
- [ ] Document bugs found with severity (🔴 Critical: BLOCKS / 🟠 High: should fix / 🟡 Medium: can release / 🟢 Low: safe)
- [ ] Write reproduction steps
- [ ] Attach evidence (logs, screenshots)

### Phase 8: Generate Validation Report

**Output file path** (determined by scope chosen above):
- `docs/testing/validation-report-full-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`
- `docs/testing/validation-report-epic-[N]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`
- `docs/testing/validation-report-story-[N.M]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

### Phase 9: Update docs/status.md (MANDATORY)

- [ ] **Read `SPEC/templates/STATUS_FORMAT.md`** — mandatory format for status.md
- [ ] Read existing `docs/status.md` first; if it does not exist, create it using `SPEC/templates/STATUS_FORMAT.md` format
- [ ] Updates to make:
  - **Updated By** → `QA`
  - **Progress Summary** → Set "QA" row to `✅ Done` (if full validation passed) or `🟡 In Progress` (if partial/failed)
  - **Current Step Details** → Document validation scope, overall result (PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL), and output file path
  - **Completed Steps** → Add validation report with evidence: `docs/testing/validation-report-[scope]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`
  - **Agent Activity** → Update QA: last action = "Validation complete ([scope])", status = Idle

Report to user:
```
✅ docs/status.md updated
   Step: QA → [status]
   Validation: [PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL]
```

## Output

---

## Rules

- 🔴 ALWAYS read the corresponding test plan first
- 🔴 ACTUALLY run tests — never assume they pass
- 🔴 Capture evidence (logs, coverage output) for every gate
- 🔴 Every requirement must have documented test evidence
- 🔴 Critical bugs = release blocked, no exceptions
- 🔴 Write ONLY to `docs/testing/` and `docs/reviews/`
- 🔴 Output file name MUST reflect chosen scope and date

---

## After Validation — Mandatory Next-Step Output (DO NOT IMPROVISE)

After writing the validation report, the ONLY message you present is the block below. Do NOT invent alternative paths or self-assign fixes.

```
📋 Validation complete — <validation report path>
   [P] tests passing | [F] failures | [B] bugs found

▶️ Next step:

1️⃣  **aire-qa-regression**   ← recommended next — confirm nothing else broke
2️⃣  **aire-qa-triage**        ← run if failures/bugs were found, to classify and prioritize

Type your choice (1 / 2).
```

If zero failures and zero bugs, present option 1 as "recommended" and dim options 2 & 3.

---

**Tell me the scope (full / epic N / story N.M), then type "proceed".**
