# IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FORMAT - MANDATORY

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Each story is written as an individual file — follow exactly

---

## 🔢 SEQUENTIAL NUMBERING - NEVER RESET

**Rule**: Epic/story numbers MUST continue sequentially across entire project.

- ✅ Greenfield initial: Epic 1, Story 1.1
- ✅ Adding features: Continue from last (Epic 3.5 → 3.6 or Epic 4.1)
- ✅ Brownfield: ALWAYS continue from last
- ❌ NEVER reset to Epic 1, Story 1.1 (except first plan)

**Determine Starting Numbers**:

1. Run: `aire next-number` (scans existing plans)
2. Manual: Check `docs/plans/implementation-plan.md` + `docs/plans/stories/` for highest numbers
3. Ask user: "Found Epic X, Story X.Y. Start from Epic [N], Story [N.M]? (yes/no)"

**Why**: Maintains history, prevents conflicts, avoids overwrites

---

## 🔀 VERTICAL FEATURE SLICES (MANDATORY)

**Rule**: Order by FEATURE, not LAYER

- ✅ Epic 1: Foundation (FE+BE scaffolding, connection test)
- ✅ Epic 2+: One feature end-to-end (BE API → FE UI → Integration)
- ✅ Testable after each epic

**❌ WRONG (Horizontal)**:
```
Epic 1: All Backend (webhook, LLM, DB)
Epic 2: All Frontend (dashboard, components)
Epic 3: Integration
Problem: Nothing works until Epic 3
```

**✅ CORRECT (Vertical)**:
```
Epic 1: Foundation
  1.1: BE Skeleton (Express, health)
  1.2: FE Skeleton (React, routing)
  1.3: Connect (health check displayed)
  ✅ TESTABLE: "Backend Connected" on homepage

Epic 2: Webhook Pipeline (Complete Feature)
  2.1: Webhook Receiver (BE)
  2.2: LLM Analyzer (BE)
  2.3: Comment Poster (BE)
  2.4: Dashboard UI (FE)
  2.5: Integration Test
  ✅ TESTABLE: PR → analysis → comment → dashboard
```

**Story Order Within Epic**: Backend → Frontend → Integration

**Why**: Testable after each epic, early feedback, low risk, clear progress

---

## 📊 STORY-DEPENDENCY GRAPH (MANDATORY when plan has 2+ stories)

**Rule**: Whenever an implementation plan contains 2 or more stories, the plan workflow MUST also produce a machine-readable dependency graph at `docs/plans/dependency-graph.yml`. The graph groups stories into **waves of independent work** so a team (or solo dev) can pick the next safe-to-start story without analysis paralysis, and so Jira / GitHub Projects can tag every story with its wave for board-level visibility.

**The graph does NOT route work to specific developers.** It declares which stories are independent. Routing is a human / board decision: anyone on the team can pick any story in the current wave.

### Artifact: `docs/plans/dependency-graph.yml`

```yaml
version: 1
generated_by: AIRE_PRODUCT_OWNER
generated_at: [YYYY-MM-DD]

team_size: 2
# Number of developers working on this project. Asked once during the plan
# workflow. Used SOLELY as a story-granularity hint: the planner aims to
# split stories so each wave contains at least `team_size` independent
# stories where the architecture allows. Not a runtime setting; not a
# routing key. A solo developer (team_size: 1) still gets a graph — the
# waves just won't be artificially widened.

shared_files:
  # Files that two or more stories may touch. Stories writing to these
  # files cannot run truly concurrently across branches without a merge
  # conflict — they are sequenced by the wave assignment.
  - package.json
  - tsconfig.base.json
  - backend/src/routes.ts
  - frontend/src/router.tsx
  - backend/migrations/

stories:
  - id: 1.0
    title: Root tooling seed (monorepo config, lint, tsconfig base)
    epic: 1
    jira: LOCAL                # Updated to PROJ-XXX after Jira export
    github: null               # Updated to issue number after GitHub export
    wave: 1
    requires: []
    enables: [1.1, 1.2, 1.3]
    files_touched:
      - package.json
      - tsconfig.base.json
      - .eslintrc.cjs
      - .prettierrc
      - .env.example
      - .gitignore
      - README.md

  - id: 1.1
    title: Backend skeleton
    epic: 1
    jira: LOCAL
    github: null
    wave: 2
    requires: [1.0]
    enables: [2.1]
    files_touched:
      - backend/package.json
      - backend/tsconfig.json
      - backend/src/server.ts
      - backend/src/app.ts
      - backend/src/routes.ts

  - id: 1.2
    title: Frontend skeleton
    epic: 1
    jira: LOCAL
    github: null
    wave: 2
    requires: [1.0]
    enables: [2.2]
    files_touched:
      - frontend/package.json
      - frontend/src/main.tsx
      - frontend/src/App.tsx
      - frontend/src/router.tsx

waves:
  - wave: 1
    stories: [1.0]
  - wave: 2
    stories: [1.1, 1.2]
```

### Schema Rules

1. **Every story has a `wave: N` field.** Same value as the wave it appears in inside the `waves:` block. This is the value pushed to Jira (`wave-N` label) and GitHub (`wave:N` label).
2. **`requires` is a list of story IDs that MUST be Done before this story starts.** Empty array if root-independent.
3. **`enables` is the reverse edge** — informational, derived from `requires`.
4. **`files_touched` lists every file the story will create or modify.** Used for merge-conflict detection.
5. **`shared_files` lists files that appear in 2+ stories' `files_touched`** — they are allowed to overlap, but stories writing to them cannot be in the same wave on different branches without a merge conflict (see Disjoint-Files Contract below).
6. **`jira` and `github` are the export keys** — `LOCAL` / `null` before export, updated by the export step.
7. **No `assignee` field on stories. No `assignments:` block at the top.** Assignment is not graph-level data; it lives on the Jira / GitHub board.

### Wave Derivation Rule

- **Wave 1** = all stories with `requires: []`.
- **Wave N+1** = all stories whose `requires` are entirely satisfied by waves ≤ N.
- The `waves:` block is regenerated whenever the graph changes.

### Disjoint-Files Contract (the core merge-safety guarantee)

For ANY two stories in the same wave:

1. Their `files_touched` lists MUST be disjoint, OR
2. Every overlapping file MUST be in `shared_files` AND must already exist in the repo (so the merge is a 3-way text merge, not a create-vs-create conflict).

**Seed-wave rule (BLOCKING — prevents the #1 real-world failure mode):**
Any file in `shared_files` that does NOT yet exist in the repo must be **created** in a single "seed" story in wave 1, with all other wave-1 stories `requires`-ing it. Two branches both creating `package.json` produce an unmergeable conflict because git has no common ancestor. The seed story collapses that creation onto one branch first.

### Per-Story Header — Required Fields

Every story file's header MUST mirror the graph entry by adding these lines:

```
**Wave**: N
**Requires**: [1.1, 1.2]
**Enables**: [2.1]
**Files Touched**:
  - src/web/health-check.tsx
  - src/web/App.tsx
```

`Wave` is the column the board uses for filtering ("show me everything in wave 3"). `Requires` and `Enables` give the human reader the same picture without opening the YAML.

### Mermaid Mirror

The implementation plan adds a `## Dependency Graph` section at the top with a Mermaid `graph TD` rendering of the YAML, color-coded by wave, plus a wave summary table. The Mermaid is for humans; if it drifts from the YAML, **the YAML wins**. The plan workflow re-renders the Mermaid from the YAML whenever the graph changes.

## CRITICAL RULES

**Every Story MUST Have**:
1. Must Read References (top - SPEC/references/, ui-ux-spec.md for FE)
2. Design Tokens if applicable (FE only - colors, spacing, typography, validation, errors)
3. Epic Context (BUILDID, epic number, name, ID, date, Jira ID)
4. Story Description (detailed explanation of what the story does, achieves, and why it matters)
5. Acceptance Criteria (comprehensive — cover every functional, edge-case, and validation scenario; as many as needed)
6. Prerequisites
7. Context Files (paths)
8. Patterns (with doc links)
9. Steps (detailed, numbered, code with tokens)
10. Tests (unit + manual)
11. Quality (linter, coverage)
12. OUT (what NOT to do)
13. Evidence (test output, screenshots)
14. **BUILDID**: Include `BUILDID` when build cycles exist (via `aire-build-cycles`)
15. **Jira**: Always include — `PROJ-101` if from Jira, `LOCAL` if created locally

**Epic Format**:
- Header ALL CAPS
- Owner, Goal
- Must Read References (if applicable)
- Prerequisites, Completion Criteria

**Reference Files**:
- TOP of epics/stories
- Full path: `SPEC/references/[file]`, `docs/ui-ux/ui-ux-spec.md` for FE
- Description for each
- DEV reads FIRST

**Design Tokens (FE)**:
- Extract from docs/ui-ux/ui-ux-spec.md
- Specify: colors, spacing, typography, validation, error display
- Use values in code: `color: '#1976D2'` not `color: 'primary'`
- Ensures beautiful UI by default

**Code Blocks**:
- Language identifier required
- Complete, executable
- Comments for non-obvious code

**Why**: Each story file is self-contained — DEV can implement it in a fresh AI session without loading the full plan
